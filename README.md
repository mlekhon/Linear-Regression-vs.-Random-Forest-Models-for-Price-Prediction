Comparative Analysis of Linear Regression and Random Forest Models for Price Prediction.
# 1. Executive Summary
This report presents the results of a comparative analysis between linear regression and random forest models for predicting prices in a given dataset. The primary objective was to assess the predictive performance of these models and determine which one provides better accuracy and insights for price prediction. The evaluation was conducted using mean absolute error, root means squared error and R-squared metrics.
# 2. Introduction
In this project, we aimed to develop accurate price prediction models for a dataset centered around room rentals. Our focus was on comparing the predictive performance of two distinct models: linear regression and random forest. By leveraging the dataset's features and attributes, we sought to determine which model offered superior accuracy in estimating prices for rental accommodations. The models were evaluated based on established metrics, shedding light on their effectiveness in addressing the price prediction task.
# 3. Methodology
# 3.1 Data Preprocessing
* The dataset was cleaned to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. 
* Features were selected based on relevance to the prediction task and potential multicollinearity issues.
# 3.2 Linear Regression Model
* A linear regression model was trained using the training set. 
* Model performance was evaluated using mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and R-squared.
# 3.3 Random Forest Model
* A random forest model was trained using the training set.
* The hyperparameters of the random forest model were tuned to optimize performance.
* Model performance was evaluated using MAE, RMSE, and R-squared.
# 3.4 Model Comparison
* The performance metrics of both models were compared to determine which model provided better predictive accuracy.
* A test set was used to evaluate the generalization ability of the random forest model.

# 5. Discussion
The discussion of the results highlights the significant superiority of the random forest model over the linear regression model in terms of predictive accuracy. The noticeably lower mean absolute error, root mean squared error and higher R-squared value achieved by the random forest model underscore its proficiency in capturing complex, non-linear relationships within the dataset. These outcomes suggest that the random forest model's inherent ability to consider multiple decision trees and their ensemble predictions enables it to more accurately forecast prices, making it a more suitable choice for this price prediction task.
# 6. Conclusion
In conclusion, this project showcased the effectiveness of the random forest model in predicting prices compared to the linear regression approach. The random forest model's ability to capture complex relationships within the data resulted in significantly improved predictive accuracy, as evidenced by its lower mean absolute error, root mean squared error, and higher R-squared value. These findings highlight the potential of leveraging advanced ensemble techniques for enhancing price prediction tasks. Moving forward, further optimization and exploration of feature engineering could unlock even greater predictive capabilities within the random forest framework.
